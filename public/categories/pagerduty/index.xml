      <description>At PagerDuty, we have a tradition of going out on a “Last Lecture”. I think PagerDuty has given me more than enough chances to speak over the past 7 years so instead I took it as a chance to share some of the best advice I’ve gotten from my coworkers. The best pieces came from multiple directions so I’ve left them all unsourced.
“The audience wants you to succeed.” That’s the advice that helped me stop dreading public speaking and it’s held true outside of a few charmingly hostile sales calls.</description>
