I’m always jealous of other people’s datasets. Although [Rally’s](http://www.rallydev.com/resource/agile-performance-metrics-whitepaper) [The Impact of Agile Quantified](http://www.rallydev.com/sites/default/files/ImpactAgile_Quantified.pdf) whitepaper is obviously targeted at getting people to adopt their product, it has some useful back of the envelope values taken from almost 10,000 projects:

* A dedicated team (>95% focus) is roughly **twice** as productive on individual tasks as one that’s sparsely focused (>50% focused on one project) (page 5)
* The median team has 25% of its members **switch teams** every 3 months (page 6)
* Team stability can increase productivity by 50%: moving from 60% of the team staying each quarter to 90% staying increases average story count from 50 to 75 (page 7)
* Small teams (1-3) move slightly faster (+17%) but ship more defects (17% again) making it a wash. (page 12)
