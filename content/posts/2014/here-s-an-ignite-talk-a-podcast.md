I overstretched myself a little last week with two speaking engagements:

* Speaking about “[Bringing Advanced Analytics to DevOps](http://www.thecloudcast.net/2014/10/the-cloudcast-167-bringing-advanced.html)“, Brian Gracely and I had a good 30 minute conversation on best practices in the ops space.
* As the opening act for [Gene Kim](http://www.realgenekim.me/), I gave an 5 minute ignite talk on “4 Magic words to get DevOps into Enterprise” (Alignment, Auditable, Risk Reduction and Recruiting) for the closing ceremonies at the [DevOps Enterprise](http://devopsenterprise.io/) conference.
