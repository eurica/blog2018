I’m doing a bit of playing around with [Conway’s Game of Life](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), first step was to roll my own implementation — since a few hours of coding can save you minutes of reading documentation. Actually, it’s really easy to simulate (and the first few implementations I saw were pretty [slow](http://euri.ca/2014/typed-array-performance-in-javascript/index.html).
