Recommended for: reading you can pick up and put down; business types looking to understand innovation.

My favourite reading is to dive into how smart people in different contexts solved problems, and historical narratives tend a lot more interesting that MBA case studies. Books like [1491](https://amzn.to/2QSfExa) or [Debt](https://amzn.to/2MV8p4b) are some of the best examples, and easily the best episode of possibly the [best podcast ever](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) was a 28 minute trip through the E[mperor Diocletian’s attempts to invent the modern world](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2011/02/127-commanding-the-economy.html). He came surprisingly close to inventing fiat currency (and was a hop, skip and a jump from fractional reserve banking) — but he invented feudalism instead.

[Fifty Inventions that Shaped the Modern Economy](https://amzn.to/2xDPMMC) is exactly what it says on the tin. It’s a quick enjoyable read, which is good, because a decent chunk of the book will be review for most readers. I hadn’t known anything about the invention of the S-pipe, but the description of Cholera-era London was covered much better in [Ghost Map](https://amzn.to/2QSdDRl).
