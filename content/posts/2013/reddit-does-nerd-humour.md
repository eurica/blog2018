Every so often, [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) has a joke thread — and I’m always meaning to remember the best ones. This time, I’m actually going to keep track of the [most intellectual jokes](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h1cyg/whats_the_most_intellectual_joke_you_know/) that I haven’t heard (and a few I have, but not in years).

All the standard disclaimers apply: some of these jokes are mildly offensive, and a few require mild background reading. A lot of them aren’t particularly intellectual.

Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Noam Chomsky walk into a bar. Heisenberg turns to the other two and says, “Clearly this is a joke, but how can we figure out if it’s funny or not?” Gödel replies, “We can’t know that because we’re inside the joke.” Chomsky says, “Of course it’s funny. You’re just telling it wrong.”

A physicist, a mathematician and an engineer stay in a hotel.  
The engineer is awakened by a smell and gets up to check it. He finds a fire in the hallway, sees a nearby fire extinguisher and after extinguishing it, goes back to bed.  
Later that night, the physicist gets up, again because of the smell of fire. He quickly gets up and sees the fire in the hallway. After calculating air pressure, flame temperature and humidity as well as distance to the fire and projected trajectory, he extinguishes the fire with the least amount of fluid.  
Then the mathematician awakens, and finds that the embers of the fire are still burning. After giving much thought to the problem, he gets up and lights it up to an actual fire. Then he goes back to sleep, satisfied that the problem has been reduced to a previously solved one.

Fidel Castro, Vladimir Putin, and the Oort Cloud are riding on a train. Fidel Castro pulls an expensive Cuban cigar out of his pocket, lights it, and then throws it out the window after only a few puffs. Vladimir Putin and the Oort Cloud are both surprised by this and ask “what are you doing, Fidel? That’s an expensive cigar!” To which Castro responds, “in your country/post-heliopausal region perhaps, but in my country these are as cheap as dirt.” Then Vladimir Putin pulls a bottle of expensive Russian vodka out of his pocket and, after a few sips, throws the bottle out the window. Fidel Castro and the Oort Cloud are both surprised and ask “what are you doing, Vladimir, that is expensive vodka!” To which Putin responds “Pah! In your country/post-heliopausal region perhaps, but in Russia this vodka is as plentiful as rainwater. The Oort Cloud considers this for a minute or two, and then throws a six-mile-wide comet out of the window which, on impact, incinerates everything within a thirty-mile radius, causes massive earthquakes and tsunamis for thousands of miles in each direction, and kicks up a cloud of dust and ash that eventually encircles the Earth wiping out nearly all forms of life in a matter of months.

A certain orchestra was performing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Now, there’s a long section in that symphony where the basses have nothing to play — just rests for pages and pages. So one of the basses suggests to the others that they should go across the street to the local bar and come back when the basses have their next entrance.  
Well, they take their time getting back, since they’ve had quite a bit to drink, and one of the basses is worried they won’t get there in time. “Don’t worry,” the first bass says, “I’ve tied a string around the conductor’s music. We’ll have plenty of time while he untangles it.”  
They get in and take their seats, but they notice the conductor has this really intense look on his face. As well he should; it was the bottom of the Ninth, the score was tied, and the basses were loaded.
